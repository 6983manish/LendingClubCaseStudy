## Conclusions
- Conclusion 1:  Univariate analysis of orderded categorical variables show:
  # 1. Applications with 5 years term is riskier than with 3 years term
  # 2. Emp length and verification status does not have significant impact on risk
  # 3. The higher the no. of delinquencies in last 2 years, higher is the risk
  # 4. An optimum # of inquiries in last 6 months in best. Too many inquiries or too less inquireis are both signs of higher risk
- Conclusion 2 :
  # 1. Applicant for 'Small business' loans are risky
  # 2. Applicants from certain zip codes like '996xx' and '997xx' are risky
  # 3. Applicants from certain state like 'AK','NE','SD' are risky
